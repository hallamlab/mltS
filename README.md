## Basic Description
This repo contains an implementation of mltS (mu**l**ti-label l**e**arning based on less-**t**rusted **S**ources) that leverages the idea of estimating memebers reliability scores in an ensemble given a small reference collection dataset. mltS assumes that multi-source multi-label dataset is provided. This dataset can be generated using external multiple multi-label algorithms (e.g. PathoLogic, MinPath, mlLGPR, triUMPF, and leADS). Next, mltS performs an iterative procedure to: (a)- train multiple local learners where each memeber is assigned to learn outputs from an algorithm; multiple instances of multi-label learning are executed, concurrently, where each instance is designated to learn from a subset of dataset generated by a particular algorithm; (b) build a discrepancy table of learners describing algorithms performances; discrepancies of learning instances using a trusted dataset are estimated and stored in a discrepancy table, where each cell in that table indicates a particular learner’s ability to predict the corresponding label; (c)- estimate the reliability of learners; Using this table, the models specific weights are updated to demonstrate which model is high likely to produce noisy labels; and (d)- optimize an overall global parameter vectors; mltS perform aggregation of models parameters, constituting a global learner. Through this approach, mltS is capable to assess the reliability of each model while providing a solution to voting during prediction in an adaptive manner. mltS was evaluated on the pathway prediction task using 10 multi-organism pathway datasets, where the experiments revealed that mltS achieved very compelling and competitive performances against the state-of-the-art pathway inference algorithms. After training is accomplished, mltS can be used for inference in three ways: “meta-predict (mp)”, “meta-weight (mw)”, and “meta-adaptive (ma)”.
